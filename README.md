**About**

The book by Stephan Hagemann introduces a modern approach to modularizing large Rails apps using **Packwerk packages** instead of traditional gems and engines. It emphasizes **incremental, practical modularization** to manage complexity, improve structure, and enable better collaboration in growing codebases.

Key topics include:
- Why gems and engines fall short (dependency/configuration drift, global side effects)
- How to get started with Packwerk and build modular packages
- Techniques for refactoring dependencies and privacy violations
- Tooling from Gusto's **RubyAtScale** ecosystem
- Metrics for measuring modularization progress
- Strategies to drive modularization efforts in teams

It encourages Rails developers to evolve into better software engineers through deliberate architecture and thoughtful modularization.
